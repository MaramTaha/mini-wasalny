# 🚀 Mini Wasalny – Smart City Navigation System

A city navigation built with **C++** and **Qt**, designed to help users explore city connections and calculate the shortest paths using fundamental data structures and graph algorithms.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Mini Wasalny** is a course project developed during a Data Structures course. It simulates a map-based city navigation system where users can:

- Add/remove cities and roads
- Explore city connectivity
- Find the shortest path between cities using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- View everything through a graphical interface
